# Two ways to add/remove widgets in a CartoDB dashboard

This template was based on [Abel's platypus](https://github.com/CartoDB/platypus). 

## Option A [v1 or blue]

This options is based on [one of my blocks](http://bl.ocks.org/ramiroaznar/c2a7c25644bd1f32da12c4520c9296fd). Basically, it uses the basic functions from [DeepInsights.js repository](https://github.com/CartoDB/deep-insights.js) `createCategoryWidget` and `remove()`method.

## Option B [v2 or red]

On the other hand, this option uses two Abel's custom functions `addWidget` and `removeWidget`.
